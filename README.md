A deterministic automotive simulation and testing platform for Software-in-the-Loop, Hardware-in-the-Loop, and CI/CD validation pipelines.

## What is BoAt?

BoAt is a tick-based simulation gateway that bridges virtual and physical CAN/Ethernet networks. It provides a deterministic simulation engine, a plugin SDK for custom node logic, a gRPC API surface, and a Python CLI/SDK.

## Key capabilities

- **Deterministic core** — Tick-based scheduler with seeded determinism guarantees bit-identical replay across runs and environments.
- **CAN & Ethernet HIL** — Supports both virtual (`vcan*`) and physical CAN interfaces (PEAK PCAN, Kvaser, gs_usb) via SocketCAN, plus virtual Ethernet over UDP multicast.
- **Plugin SDK** — C ABI **v8** plugin interface built around a single unified `BoatFrame` type (CAN/CAN-FD/Ethernet/PDU/TCP). Plugins implement `on_tick`, `on_frame`, `set_frame_publisher`, and `declared_buses`. The core owns the stateless transport substrate: the single `FrameSink` is the only path a frame reaches a bus, and `PluginManager::DispatchFrame()` delivers inbound frames to plugins' `on_frame`, filtered to their declared bus types. `BOAT_CAN_FLAG_SELF_SENT` (0x08) / `BOAT_ETH_FLAG_SELF_SENT` (0x01) tag locally-sent frames to prevent self-loop. Load `.so` plugins at runtime with JSON config (`plugin.so?{...}`). Plugins own stateful conversations only — built-in set: PduRouter, CAN-TP (ISO 15765-2), TCP, SOME/IP.
- **Dual PluginManager architecture** — Two independent `PluginManager` instances run concurrently: a simulation-scoped manager (driven by the tick scheduler during simulation runs) and an always-on node manager (driven by its own independent tick thread for persistent plugins like CAN-TP). Both managers use the same ABI but serve different lifetimes.
- **gRPC API** — 16 protobuf services: Simulation, Signal, Scenario, Replay, Fault, Metrics, Trace, the unified **Frame** service (send/subscribe for all bus types), CAN, Ethernet, PDU, Plugin, Debug, and the always-on BusService.
- **Python SDK + CLI** — `boat-py` package with `BoAtClient`, `FrameNode`, `PduNode` classes. `boat-cli` with commands for sim, scenario, frame (unified send/subscribe), PDU, CAN-TP, replay, trace, and plugin management (`boat can`/`boat eth` remain as deprecated wrappers).
- **PDU routing** — AUTOSAR-inspired PDU router with I-PDU groups, cyclic/onChange/mixed transmission schedules, and COM signal packing (Intel/Motorola, E2E CRC).
- **Event store & replay** — SQLite-backed event store. Deterministic replay controller reconstructs any prior simulation run.
- **Fault injection** — Seeded deterministic fault injector for reproducing fault scenarios (signal errors, CAN dropouts, timing faults).
- **Web dashboards** — 10 standalone FastAPI services providing live CAN frame traces, signal monitoring, PDU editing, trace analysis, and system dashboards.
